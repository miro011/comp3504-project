## Structure (suggestion from Terrence)
### /backend
Contains anything for the backend APIs, databases, and such.

### /frontend
Contains the web UI or app project files (if developing in an IDE).

## Change Procedure
The main branch is protected (no commits directly to it).
You must create a branch from main, make your changes, then pull request to merge into main.
_This prevents anyone from accidentally overwriting other's changes in main or rewriting the history. I think it's good practice._

## Building and Hosting
Terrence plans on making everything server-side into Docker images for easy hosting.
